  - Here Come the Girls 2009
  - Manchester Art Gallery Atrium
  - 1100 Wine Glasses
  - Lipstick
  -
  -
  - 'Commissioned by Manchester Art Gallery to celebrate the festive season and specifically to link to their exhibition Angels of Anarchy: Women Artists and Surrealism.  The primary reference is to Meret Oppenheim’s iconic fur teacup, saucer and spoon, Object.  In a contemporary culture where women are just as likely to drink wine as tea the vessel still functions as a metaphor for the female body, but in the 21st century sexual politics have evolved.'
  -
  - 'Each glass is individually rimmed with lipstick using the artist’s lips.  Cosmetics, particularly lipstick, are often advertised as a way to enhance feminine power and choice, and one cosmetic company even used the slogan ‘It’s not makeup, it’s ammunition’.'

  - <em>“While thinking of ‘strong women’ femininity, power and Christmastime, I was reminded of the recent Boots TV commercials with crowds of women getting glammed up and marching out to celebrate to the Sugababes ‘Here come the Girls’.”</em>  Susie MacMurray
  -
  - The work offers a space for rumination on the evolution of feminism and perceptions of female power/empowerment in it’s various guises – cultural/political/sexual.  Also on the different ways women choose to exercise that empowerment (including binge drinking), the ambiguities it throws up, and psychological bargains we strike with ourselves.
