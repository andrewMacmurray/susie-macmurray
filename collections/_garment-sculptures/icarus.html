  - WWF commissioned a collection of works from leading artists, designers and architects for Padamonium in Hyde Park. The pieces were intended to inspire awareness of WWFâ€™s breadth of work.
  -
  - Curated by Artwise, each artist contributed a piece of wearable sculpture or performance. The Pandamonium collection included fashion, textile, interaction, millinery and music. The works were auctioned during an open air catwalk show to raise funds and highlight the work of the WWF.
