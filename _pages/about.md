Susie MacMurray is a British artist whose work includes drawing, sculpture and architectural installations.  A former classical musician, she retrained as an artist, graduating with an MA in Fine Art in 2001.  She lives in Manchester and has an international exhibition profile, showing regularly in the USA and Europe as well as the UK.

An engagement with materials and with the body is at the heart of MacMurray’s practice. Her role is one of an alchemist: combining material, form and context in deceptively simple ways to stimulate both physical and cultural associations within those who encounter her work.

Working in installation and sculpture she has gained a reputation for poetic site-specific interventions in historic spaces. Her work typically references the history of a space and merges the particularities of that history, the specifics of the site, and the meanings of materials to gain insight and raise questions about the relationship between place and people.

Drawing is an important part of MacMurray’s practice. In addition to her large scale pen & ink work she extends the possibilities of making drawings using unconventional materials including rubber tubing, hair and wax. She also makes pen & ink drawings on a more intimate scale and produces sculptural wall pieces and other work for private commissions.
